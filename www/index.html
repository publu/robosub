<p>Historically, the University of Texas at Dallas has placed among the top three in the AUVSI RoboSub competition. We intend to bring the team back to a competitive level and put UTD back on the leaderboard. Through our efforts and your generous support of our organization, we will inspire future UTD students to similarly pursue their interests and grow as students and Engineers. Furthermore, working on our team teaches students the valuable skill of how to work in a multidisciplinary team.</p>
